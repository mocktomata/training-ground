# Training Ground

Welcome to the training ground of [mocktomata].

There are many (?) exercises you can go through in this training ground to help you get familiar with [mocktomata].

To get started, fork this repo and clone it locally.

## Setup

This training ground uses [pnpm] as the package manager.

If you are using an older version of NodeJS,
run `corepack enable` to enable it.

To setup, run this in your terminal:

```sh
pnpm install
```

## Getting started

Each training has an alias added at the root.
You can start each training directly from the root:

- `pnpm evil start`
